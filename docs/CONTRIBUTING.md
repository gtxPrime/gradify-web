## 🎨 UI/UX Guidelines

- Ensure any new component integrates well with the existing **CSS definitions**.
- We lean heavily into **glassmorphism**, dynamic interactions, and fully responsive layouts.
- Always verify design in **Dark Mode**.
- Ensure any animations utilize the site's existing CSS transition properties or **GSAP**.

## 💻 Tech Stack Rules

- **Vanilla JS**: Keep dependencies minimal. If you intend to introduce a heavy package, propose it first.
- **Firebase**: Never commit API keys related to user write-privileges.

## 🎯 Current Needs

- Improving accessibility (ARIA labels).
- Performance optimizations.
- Additional web-specific tools and calculators.
